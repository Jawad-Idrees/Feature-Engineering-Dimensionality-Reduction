The repo covers dimensionality reduction which is an important part of Data Preprocessing. It depicts different techniques through which we 
can choose columns that are most relevant to our task.
* We used visualizations and correlations mostly for feature selection
* We used data visualization to see distribution of features for missing value imputation.
* We first tried linear regression for modeling
* Then to improve the results, we tried multiple famous algorithms and it resulted in improved performance.
